# We.Travel1
Mobile iOS application to coordinate vacations, built with a group of students at the University of Southern California.

I handeled backend development, as well as project management throught the course of development. Specifically on the backend,
I created functionality for user login and registration, Yelp API interaction and use cases, and backend database communication.

We used Yelp Fusion API to create location specific recomendations for a variety of categories based on key words entered by users, including Food, Nightlife, Art, Music, Hotels, and others.

Our database management system used for the project was MySQL.
